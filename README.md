# Welcome to my Flutter Monster Game App!

We lose less time commuting now that we work from home but usually I love mobile games when I commute.
This is the reason why I tried to build an Flutter Game!

So, this app is only an example how to use Flame for Flutter, it is a game engine that provides a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for games.

## Built With

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
